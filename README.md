# Daily Journal
abstract, description, and solution for works, jobs, care for Benjamin for records

This repository contains md files to keep records while I live in the world, until saying good bye to the world.

Basically, each file stands for each ticket like Jira and the file has five categories like below.
1. Abstract
2. Description for additional details
3. Solution
4. Progress: New, In Progress, Resolved
5. (optional) Additional contents like photo or something else

Every day I get something, which is worth to record in here, just add here for recording.
